# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem involving the creatin of a software, it is beneficial to break down the requirements into smaller tasks/features. For this project, I prioritized the dashboard's functionality and how it would allow users to interact with MongoDB. In the future, I would continue to understanding client needs first, then develop a solution that can be broen down into components and keep up as requirements evolve.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems by designing and building software solutions that can scale and adapt to ever chnaging business needs. For this project, the Python module and web dashboard allow Grazioso Salvare visualize and manage animal shelter data.
